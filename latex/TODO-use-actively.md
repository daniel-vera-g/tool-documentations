## Drawing figures

1. Draw Shapes through keyboard shortcuts
2. Use key chords to apply commonly used styles
3. Add text with latex in inkscape
4. add and save objects

- **Press clusters of keys (key chords) to apply common styles.** Pressing <kbd>d</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> gives a **d**otted **a**rrow, <kbd>f</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> **f**ills the selection in gray and adds a **s**troke. You want a circle that's **d**otted and **f**illed? Press <kbd>f</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>. Try pressing combinations of <kbd>s</kbd>, <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd>, <kbd>g</kbd>, <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>x</kbd>, <kbd>e</kbd>, <kbd>b</kbd>, <kbd>f</kbd>, <kbd>w</kbd>. Being able to combine these common styles by pressing key chords feels quite intuitive after a while.
- **Save custom styles and objects.** Press <kbd>Shift+S</kbd> or <kbd>Shift+A</kbd> to give a style or object a name. Use it by pressing <kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd>a</kbd> and typing the name. For common styles that aren't covered by the key chords, this comes in handy.
- **Use your editor to write LaTeX.** Pressing <kbd>t</kbd> opens an instance of vim (or any editor you want). Write some LaTeX, close it, and the shortcut manager pastes the text in the figure. Pressing <kbd>Shift+T</kbd> does the same but renders the LaTeX as an svg and adds it to the document.
- **Ergonomic shortcuts for frequently used functions**. Press <kbd>w</kbd> for pencil, <kbd>x</kbd> to toggle snapping, <kbd>f</kbd> for Bézier, <kbd>z</kbd> to undo, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>z</kbd> to delete and <kbd>\`</kbd> to dis/enable the shortcut manager.

# Lecture structure

## TODO lecture structure

1. Keeping track of current curses
2. Schortcuts with schortcut tool
3. yq to work with yaml
4. Use vim server to work efficiently with it

# Vim

> Use & master vim to take the most out of the workflow

# Regex

> Learn regex to take the most out of vim, shell & co

# TODO in general

* use docker to run latex & completely remove latex from sytsem -> integrate
devops to latex
CI/CD for latex = Compile, create PDF, lint, check Spelling, ....
use docker, vagrant & VM for all big systems that need to be installed(f.ex
latex, ....)
Use Devops, ...Mentality for every project


set up ci/cd for latex = linting, grammar, code org, indenting....-> Take
example proffesional ci/cd stuff

----

latex TODO:

tabellen & darstellungen in latex
Bilder & math.zeichnugen in Latex
Zeichnungen mithilfe von Programm machen
links in latex
nice illustrations in latex
automatic mathematiclal calculations in latex
see website from castell latex notes
set up http for pushing code
koordinatensysteme, vektoren, ... in latex einfügen...
use inkscape for mathematical design
draw mathematical structures fast
automate everything -> Think in terms of automation & have as a goal to
automate everything, do as little as possible & keep as much headspace as
possible

---

1. Tools doc repo issues
2. latex setup repo issues
3. CI bookmarks firefox

---


be sure to mimmic markdown latex
latex linter,grammer, vocab, ... ... -> Set up ci/cd...
learn create snippets
use Different math environements
learn & have as goal to automate everything & do anything as efficient as
possible -> Use math + coding to be more efficient & effective -> Automate!
foldings in vim ...
spelling & grammar check
set up ci/cd:
    format latex code
    check spelling and grammar
    check latex syntax
    compile & check errors
    ...
aim to be as effective s possible at text editing & leave energy to executing & thinking
review all latex schortcuts & use them more actively to automate more typing -> Automate most of the stuff!
search for further ultisnips & use them productively in class to write math faster
