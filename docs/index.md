# Tool docs

This is the home for the documentation about all the tools I use.
It is mainly a compilation of information gathered from all around the web(Stack Overflow, Blogs, ...).

I hope you find/learn something interesting here.

## Motivation

The motivation was not having to always look information up, but having a central source of truth.
Current topics documented are amongst other things:

1. Git related questions.
2. Latex editing workflows.
3. Linux cheat sheets, questions and hacks.
4. Vim principles, hacks and helpers.

If you think, that I've forgot to mention some source where I got the information, don't bother to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DVG3012) or simply per mail [danielveragi@gmail.com](mailto:danielveragi@gmail.com).

## Additional resources

## Build with

This site is build with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and based on the [Grundgesetz](https://grundgesetz-skeleton.kata-ai.now.sh/) template.

### Deploy

Currently this site uses simple a `travis.yml` script and the `npm deploy` command with `gh-pages` to automatically build the page from master.
